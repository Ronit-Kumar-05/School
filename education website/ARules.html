            </span>
            <p>
                * Reach at your school bus stop at least 10 minutes before the scheduled time of bus arrival, Therefore leave home well in time, so that you wonâ€™t have to run to catch the bus. <br>
                * At the bus stop, always follow the queue. Board the bus only after it has come to a halt, without rushing in or pushing others. <br>
                * Do not board or alight at a bus stop other than the one decided by the school. Never board and alight at a red light crossing or unauthorized bus stop. <br>
                * Always hold onto the handrail if standing in a moving bus, especially at sharp turns. <br>
                * While in the bus, shouting, singing or making noise are definitely bad manners. Such behavior can distract the driver resulting in mishap. <br>
                * Do not sit, stand or travel on the footboard of the bus. <br>
                * Do not put any part of your body outside a moving or stationary bus.<br>
